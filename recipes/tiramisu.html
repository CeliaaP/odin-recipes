    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Remember that trip you took to Italy one summer where you had <strong>THE BEST</strong> tiramisu <em>ever</em>? We've all been there. As tempting as it would be to take another trip for another taste of heaven, there is an easier way.</p>
    <p>Delicious Tiramisu that tastes just like the one you had in Italy? Count me in! Coffee, cocoa, lady fingers, and oh yea did I say coffee? Need I say more? Just follow the simple steps below.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese ,room temperature</li>
    <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
    <li>3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur ,optional (Kahlua or DaVinci brands)</li>
    <li>1 package Lady Fingers ,Savoiardi brand can be found in the cookie aisle at your local grocery store, or online</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder for dusting the top</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan.</li>
    <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
    <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
